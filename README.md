# remodeling
The original wiki rewritten as a single page application

# process
We will focus on restoring some service as soon as possible. Then advance a broader agenda in several more stages.
Throught our remodel we will focus on simple implementation with minimum dependencies
requiring the least attention in years ahead.

- [return wiki to 95% service](https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/1)
- [full service static site](https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/2)
- [integrate with read-write federated wiki pods](https://github.com/WardCunningham/remodeling/issues/3)

# preview
We have a test deployment running available for previewing.
Review our checklists above to align your expectations.
We're aware of missing data and all formats are provisional.
